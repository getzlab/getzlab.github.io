# Abstract

Manual review is an integral part of any study. As the cost of data generation continues to decrease, the rapid rise in large-scale multi-omic studies calls for a modular, flexible framework to perform what is currently a tedious, error-prone process. We developed AnnoMate, a Python-based package built with Plotly Dash that creates interactive, highly customizable dashboards for reviewing and annotating data. Its object-oriented framework enables easy development and modification of custom dashboards for specific manual review tasks. We utilized this framework to implement “reviewer” dashboards for various tasks often performed in cancer genome sequencing studies.
