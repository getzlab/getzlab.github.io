# Abstract

Although the development of multiple primary tumors in smokers with lung cancer can be attributed to carcinogen-induced field cancerization, the occurrence of multiple tumors at presentation in individuals with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who lack known environmental exposures remains unexplained. In the present study, we identified ten patients with early stage, resectable, non-small cell lung cancer who presented with multiple, anatomically distinct, EGFR-mutant tumors. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among multiple tumors from each patient using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and hypermutable poly(guanine) (poly(G)) repeat genotyping as orthogonal methods for lineage tracing. In four patients, developmental mosaicism, assessed by WES and poly(G) lineage tracing, indicates a common non-germline cell of origin. In two other patients, we identified germline EGFR variants, which confer moderately enhanced signaling when modeled in vitro. Thus, in addition to germline variants, developmental mosaicism defines a distinct mechanism of genetic predisposition to multiple EGFR-mutant primary tumors, with implications for their etiology and clinical management.
