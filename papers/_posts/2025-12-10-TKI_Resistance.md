# Abstract

Though there has been substantial progress in the development of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapies to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) within the past two decades, most patients still experience disease progression and cancer-related death. HER2-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be highly effective therapies for patients with HER2-positive MBC; however, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is needed to better inform treatment approaches. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 111 patients with 73 tumor biopsies and 120 cell-free DNA samples to assess mechanisms of resistance. In 11 of 26 patients with acquired resistance, we identified alterations in previously characterized genes, such as PIK3CA and ERBB2, that could explain treatment resistance. Mutations in growing subclones identified potential mechanisms of resistance in 5 of 26 patients and included alterations in ESR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4. Additional studies are needed to assess the functional role and clinical utility of these alterations in driving resistance.
