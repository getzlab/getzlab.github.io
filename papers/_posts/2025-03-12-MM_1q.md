# Abstract

The development of targeted therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is hampered by the low frequency of actionable genetic abnormalities. Gain or amplification of chromosome 1q (1q+) is the most frequent arm-level copy number gain in patients with MM and is associated with higher risk of progression and death despite recent therapeutic advances. Thus, developing targeted therapy for MM patients with 1q+ stands to benefit a large portion of patients in need of more effective management. Here, we employed large-scale dependency screens and drug screens to systematically characterize the therapeutic vulnerabilities of MM with 1q+ and displayed increased sensitivity to MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we compared subclones with and without 1q+ within the same patient tumors and demonstrated that 1q+ is associated with higher levels of MCL1 and the PI3K pathway. Furthermore, by isolating isogenic clones with different copy number profiles for part of the chromosome 1q arm, we observed increased sensitivity to MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors with arm-level gain. Lastly, we demonstrated synergy between MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors and dissected their mechanism of action in MM with 1q+, uncovering a cytostatic effect. In conclusion, this study highlights that MM with 1q+ may present enhanced sensitivity to MCL1 and PI3K inhibitors, enabling their use at lower doses without sacrificing efficacy, and may thus accelerate the development of targeted therapy for patients with MM and 1q+.
