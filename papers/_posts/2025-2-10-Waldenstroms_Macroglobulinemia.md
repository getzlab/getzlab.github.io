# Abstract

Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) is an IgM-secreting bone marrow (BM) lymphoma that is preceded by an asymptomatic state (AWM). To dissect tumor-intrinsic and immune mechanisms of progression, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing on 294,206 BM tumor and immune cells from 30 patients with AWM/WM, 26 patients with Smoldering Myeloma, and 23 healthy donors. Despite their early stage, patients with AWM present extensive immune dysregulation, including in normal B cells, with disease-specific immune hallmarks. Patient T and NK cells show systemic hypo-responsiveness to interferon, which improves with interferon administration and may represent a therapeutic vulnerability. MYD88-mutant tumors show transcriptional heterogeneity, which can be distilled in a molecular classification, including a DUSP22/CD9-positive subtype, and progression signatures which differentiate IgM MGUS from overt WM and can help advance WM research and clinical practice.
