# Abstract

Mutagenic processes and clonal selection contribute to the development of therapy-associated secondary neoplasms, a known complication of cancer treatment. The association between tamoxifen therapy and secondary uterine cancers is uncommon but well established; however, the genetic mechanisms underlying tamoxifen-driven tumorigenesis remain unclear. We find that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations, common in spontaneously arising estrogen-associated de novo uterine cancer, are significantly less frequent in tamoxifen-associated tumors. In vivo, tamoxifen-induced estrogen receptor stimulation activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in normal mouse uterine tissue, potentially eliminating the selective benefit of PI3K-activating mutations in tamoxifen-associated uterine cancer. Together, we present a unique pathway of therapy-associated carcinogenesis in which tamoxifen-induced activation of the PI3K pathway acts as a non-genetic driver event, contributing to the multistep model of uterine carcinogenesis. While this PI3K mechanism is specific to tamoxifen-associated uterine cancer, the concept of treatment-induced signaling events may have broader applicability to other routes of tumorigenesis.
