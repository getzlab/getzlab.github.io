# Abstract

T cell alloreactivity against minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs)-polymorphic peptides resulting from donor-recipient (D-R) disparity at sites of genetic polymorphisms-is at the core of the therapeutic effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Despite the crucial role of mHAgs in graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) reactions, it remains challenging to consistently link patient-specific mHAg repertoires to clinical outcomes. Here we devise an analytic framework to systematically identify mHAgs, including their detection on HLA class I ligandomes and functional verification of their immunogenicity. The method relies on the integration of polymorphism detection by whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA from D-R pairs with organ-specific transcriptional- and proteome-level expression. Application of this pipeline to 220 HLA-matched allo-HCT D-R pairs demonstrated that total and organ-specific mHAg load could independently predict the occurrence of acute GvHD and chronic pulmonary GvHD, respectively, and defined promising GvL targets, confirmed in a validation cohort of 58 D-R pairs, for the prevention or treatment of post-transplant disease recurrence.
