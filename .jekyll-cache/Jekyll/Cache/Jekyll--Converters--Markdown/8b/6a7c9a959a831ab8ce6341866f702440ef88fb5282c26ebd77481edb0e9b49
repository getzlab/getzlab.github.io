<p>Cancer is a disease of the genome that is driven by a combination of possible germline risk-alleles together with a set of ‚Äúdriver‚Äù somatic mutations that are acquired during the clonal expansion of increasingly fitter clones. In order to generate a comprehensive list of all germline and somatic events that occurred during life and the development of the cancer, we are developing and applying highly sensitive and specific tools for detecting different types of mutations in massively-parallel sequencing data. The volume and complexity of these data require developing computational tools using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches to extract the signal from the noise (e.g., MuTect, dRanger, MSMuTect, etc.).</p>
