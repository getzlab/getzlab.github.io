I pretty much freeload off of Farmer Chet.  Every morning he lets me and my girls out of the coop and gives us plenty of chicken feed and corn to eat.  In the evening, after we have returned to the coop, he closes the coop door to keep us safe from coyotes and foxes.

Until recently I attended the weekly lab standups and reported on my activities, but I'm afraid I don't contribute much to the lab.  But that's OK...I'm just a chicken!
