Eleonora is a physician and research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Margaret Shipp at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she is co-mentored by Dr. Gad Getz.

She obtained her medical degree from the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano in Italy and completed her residency in hematology and oncology at Humanitas University in Milan, where she began exploring translational research through studies of circulating tumor DNA profiling for outcome prediction in lymphomas.

Her research interests center on the integration of genomics and molecular profiling to better understand diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with particular emphasis on therapeutic targets and mechanisms of resistance. Her translational research focuses on leveraging biomarker-driven approaches to guide precision medicine strategies.
