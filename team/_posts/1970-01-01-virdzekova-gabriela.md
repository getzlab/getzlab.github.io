Gabriela is a postdoctoral fellow in the Getz lab and the Crompton lab (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). She received her PhD in Cancer Science from University of Southampton in 2022. Her previous work involved applying single-cell RNA-seq to uncover the role of AKT signaling in CD8+ T cell differentiation and response to immune checkpoint blockers.

In her current research, Gabriela investigates mechanisms of tumor evolution in high-risk neuroblastoma patients using circulating tumor DNA. In another project, she studies the mechanisms of metastasis in neuroblastoma using single-cell RNA-seq analysis of circulating tumor cells.

In her spare time, Gabriela enjoys running, painting and reading.
