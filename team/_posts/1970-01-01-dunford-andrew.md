Andrew Dunford has been a member of the Getz Lab since October 2013.  In his tenure he has worked on multiple cancer types, including lymphoma and myeloma, as well as contributed to novel methods for identifying somatic mutations in the absence of paired normals, as well as worked on project spanning cancer types, such as by identifying genes on chromosome X that contribute to elevated risk of cancer in men.  Starting in January 2022, Andrew has begun studying as an environmental engineer in the hopes of curing cancer at the source by applying the quantitative outlook he's learned in the lab to creating an environment without toxicants.
