James is a rising senior at Skidmore College studying Neuroscience. He joined the lab as a summer intern and is working on analyzing whole genome data using computational tools developed in the lab. James has previous experience in cancer research. Last summer, he worked at a startup in small molecule drug discovery where he performed wet lab procedures such as tissue culture and various cellular assays. After completing his undergraduate degree, James plans to pursue an MD-PhD in neuroscience. 

Outside of the lab, James enjoys playing classical guitar, reading, and going fishing with friends. Additionally, he spent last semester studying at the University of Copenhagen, where he traveled to many other European countries.
