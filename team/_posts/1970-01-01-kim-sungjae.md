Sungjae received his PhD in Biomedical Science from Seoul National University in 2022. His previous works covered both germline and cancerous research including constructing a whole-genome reference panel for genotype imputation, applying RNA-seq based approach to identify subtypes with highlighted tumor microenvironment, and demonstrating the advantages of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing in polygenic risk score calculation.

Sungjae joined the Getz Lab as a postdoctoral associate in March 2023, and is focusing on investigating cancer in depth. His current research interests include genomic analysis to reveal how germline risks contribute to cancer, and discovery of novel subtypes within cancer patients that can potentially show responses to therapy using multi-omics analyses.
