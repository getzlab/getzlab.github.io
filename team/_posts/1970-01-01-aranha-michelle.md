Michelle is a computational biologist in the Ghobrial Lab (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and a post-doctoral researcher in the Getz Lab. Prior to joining the Getz and Ghobrial labs, Michelle received a PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and completed postdoctoral training in computational biophysics from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. During her graduate and post-doctoral training, she focused on using molecular simulations and modeling to understand different biophysical processes.
Michelleâ€™s current research focusses on using single-cell RNA sequencing to understand and characterize the changes in the tumor immune microenvironment in patients with precursor and full-blown multiple myeloma.
