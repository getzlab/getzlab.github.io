Kate is a senior at MIT majoring in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. She joined the Getz lab in September of 2024 as an undergraduate student under MITâ€™s Advanced Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and is currently working on a project studying the molecular genetics and genomics of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She is also involved in wet lab cancer biology research at the MIT Koch Institute For Integrative Cancer Research, and is particularly interested in questions surrounding chromosomal and genomic instability in cancer. After completing her undergraduate degree, Kate hopes to pursue graduate studies in cancer biology. Outside of the lab, she enjoys reading, making art, and doing the NYT daily crossword with friends.
