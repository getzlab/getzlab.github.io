As a scientific storyteller, my role in lab is to help communicate the Getz Labâ€™s exciting breakthroughs to the global cancer research community. I specialize in scientist-to-scientist communication and primarily help Getz lab members edit and write journal article manuscripts and grants. I also aid in creating or refining other written material related to lab function or disseminating our science to wider audiences, such as this website or through social media. 

My background: I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry and minor in English Literature from Hartwick College and earned my PhD in Immunology at The University of Chicago working in the lab of Dr. Yang-Xin Fu.
