Brian is the Associate Director of Scientific Operations for the Cancer Genome Computational Analysis Group (Getz Lab). In this role, he oversees the group’s daily operations, manages project development, funding, and execution, and serves as the Alliance Manager for key collaborations. His responsibilities include developing and maintaining collaborator relationships, defining project scopes, goals, and budgets, and facilitating the data analysis and publication phases of each project.

Brian earned his PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Delaware and completed postdoctoral fellowships at Rice University and MD Anderson Cancer Center. His scientific research spans ocular lens and extracellular matrix biology, cancer biology, targeted nanoparticle delivery and cellular ablation, and the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance.

Before joining the Broad Institute, Brian was an Instructor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, where he collaborated with clinicians and scientists on translational cancer research focused on advanced papillary thyroid cancer. Prior to his PhD, he worked as a system engineer, building and maintaining UNIX servers and fiber optic storage area networks.

Brian’s career has been driven by a passion for improving and simplifying methods and processes. He applies this passion to projects aimed at improving patient outcomes by advancing our understanding of resistance to cancer therapies.
