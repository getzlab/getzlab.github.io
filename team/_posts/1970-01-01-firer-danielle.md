I joined the Getz Lab in the summer of 2020 as an Associate Computational Biologist. I currently use single cell analysis to elucidate progression of precursor conditions of Multiple Myeloma.

I recieved B.S.s in Computer Science and Bioengineering from the University of Maryland, CP. In the future I plan to continue my studies in computational biology in graduate school.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing volleyball, running, and hiking as well as cooking and baking to bring with me on my adventures.
