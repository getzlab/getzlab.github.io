Dory Abelman is a postdoctoral researcher in the Getz Lab and Ghobrial Lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute. He is completing his PhD in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, where he developed whole-genome approaches for identifying minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma and built machine-learning models that integrate methylation and fragmentation features for pan-cancer detection from cell-free DNA. His work also includes targeted TCR and BCR sequencing to track immune repertoire changes and circulating tumor burden, as well as single-cell and RNA-based analyses to study mechanisms of drug resistance.

In the Getz Lab, Dory works on computational methods to track patient-specific genomic “fingerprints” in cfDNA, integrate single-cell sequencing data, and model how tumor burden and therapy shape evolutionary trajectories across cancer types. He is particularly interested in applying statistical and cfDNA-based approaches to identify predictors of progression from smoldering to active myeloma, understand the impact of early intervention, uncover new therapeutic vulnerabilities, and develop screening strategies for cancers that currently lack effective early-detection tools.

Outside the lab, Dory enjoys teaching, architectural and landscape photography (often with a drone), painting, spending time in nature, hiking, kayaking, and exploring new places.
