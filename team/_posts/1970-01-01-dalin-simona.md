Simona completed her PhD at MIT where she studied chemotherapy resistance with Mike Hemann and Doug Lauffenburger. She is now a postdoctoral fellow in the Getz lab and the Beroukhim lab. Simona studies factors that influence the formation of genomic rearrangements in cancer and germline genomes.

When not in lab, Simona can be found reading science fiction, sewing, or playing with her toddler.
