I joined the Getz Lab early 2021 as an Associate Computational Biologist. I currently work on genomic analysis of leukemias (MDS/AML, CLL) and tool development for automating manual review. 

I recieved a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Biology at Georgia Tech. In the future I plan to pursue graduate school to continue my studies in computational applications in biological research. 

Outside of research, I enjoy volleyball, longboarding, and running 🏃. When I can't be outside, I also like baking 🍰, knitting, and piano 🎹.
