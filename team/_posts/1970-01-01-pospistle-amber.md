Amber joined the Getz lab in the summer of 2023 as a summer intern. Amber is a junior Computational Biology major at the University of South Carolina where she is a Goldwater and Stamps Scholar. Her research in the Getz lab involves a method to distinguish between somatic and germline mutations using tumor-only samples. In the future, she plans to attain a Ph.D. in Computational Biology and pursue a research career applying computational biology tools to study immuno-oncology and neurological disorders. Outside of research, she enjoys painting, poetry, and listening to music.
