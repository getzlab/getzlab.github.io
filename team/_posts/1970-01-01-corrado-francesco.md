Francesco is a physician and research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Irene Ghobrial at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where he is co-mentored by Dr. Gad Getz. He obtained his medical degree from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy and completed his residency in hematology and oncology at Humanitas University in Milan. His research focuses on the use of single-cell RNA sequencing to elucidate mechanisms of response and resistance to T cell–redirecting therapies in patients with multiple myeloma and its precursor conditions, with the goal of informing the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.
