Kane received his PhD in Computational Immunology from University College London in 2025. His PhD work examined the role of adaptive immunity in the haematological malignancy multiple myeloma using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell receptor sequencing, and cytometry methods. 

Kane joined the Getz Lab as postdoctoral associate in March 2025. His current research focuses on designing novel bioinformatic tools for the analysis of emerging spatial technologies, including spatial proteomics and transcriptomics, alongside multi-modal integration of spatial and non-spatial data types. His end goal is to deploy these tools on primary patient samples to understand mechanisms of progression and response to therapy.
