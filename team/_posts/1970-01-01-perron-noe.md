Noé is a Research Fellow in the labs of Gad Getz at the Broad Institute and Irene Ghobrial at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He grew up in Lyon, France, where he earned his MSc before completing a PhD in Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Florida. Though his doctoral work focused on plants, his broad fascination with how living systems organize, respond to their environments, evolve, and adapt naturally led him to explore new directions. He became captivated by the immune system, and how its interactions with the tumor microenvironment shape cancer progression. This curiosity brought him to his current work in human cancer research.

Noé's research centers on multiple myeloma, driven by a desire to reduce the burden cancer places on patients' lives. He works toward developing treatments with minimal toxicity, as well as less invasive approaches to monitoring and screening. A major focus is creating tests that can detect early signs of myeloma progression, allowing patients to receive care before the disease threatens their health or quality of life. He also studies why certain populations face higher risks of developing multiple myeloma, with the goal of ensuring equitable access to precision therapies for all patients.

Outside the lab, Noé loves discovering new music, catching concerts around Boston, and playing music and board games. Above all, he enjoys spending time with his wife and their cat, Soup.
