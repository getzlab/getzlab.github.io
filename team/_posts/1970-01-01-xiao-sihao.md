Sihao, who earned an MSc in Genomic Medicine from Imperial College London in 2019, played a key role in using whole-genome sequencing to investigate respiratory rare diseases. He has extensive industry experience at the Beijing Genome Institute, Asia's largest genome research company, leading projects on pan-genomes, pharmacogenomics, chronic diseases, and cancer early diagnosis. Using machine learning, he developed industry-leading models for accurate cancer diagnosis and Tissue-of-origin identification. 

In 2025, he completed his DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford under Prof. Cornelia van Duijn. His self-designed machine learning pipeline produced proteomic/metabolic aging clocks that accurately predict future disease risks and early mortality, and a proteomic Smoking Index to predict smoking-related disease and quantify recovery in former smokers. 

Sihao is now a Postdoctoral Associate in the Getz Lab, investigating the clonal history of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Richter's Syndrome and developing models for prognosis of recurrence, transformation, and drug resistance based on molecular signatures.
