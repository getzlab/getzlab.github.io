Erik received his PhD in computer vision / machine learning in 2008, and has since then worked on related topics in a wide range of application areas. Erik also has an entrepreneurial background, founding an expert consulting agency within computer vision and serving as CTO in a scale-up company in the field. However, his main interests are still hands-on research and research-related software development.

Erik joined the Getz Lab in 2025 in a remote part-time position. His focus is the analysis of spatial data such as histology images and spatial transcriptomics/proteomics.

Erik simultaneously holds a research position in the Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis group at Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden). This setup provides the Getz Lab with a direct connection to current research within computer vision / machine learning, and an outside perspective on the spatial data analysis challenges encountered in the lab.
