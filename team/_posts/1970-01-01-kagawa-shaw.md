Shaw joined the lab in May of 2023 as an Associate Computational Biologist, currently working on the computational discovery of cancer drug targets. Shaw had previously worked with Dr. C.-H. Christina Cheng at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign on the genome assembly and comparative genomics of antifreeze proteins.

Outside of work, Shaw has recently started bouldering, enjoys arts and crafts, plays video games casually, and practices playing the French horn.
