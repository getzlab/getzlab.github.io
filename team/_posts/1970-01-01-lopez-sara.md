Sara is a fifth-year PhD student in Genomic and Molecular Approaches to Biomedicine at the University of Oviedo, under the supervision of Dr. Xosé Antón Suárez Puente. Her research focuses on understanding how splicing deregulation affects hematological tumors, with a particular emphasis on how these changes reshape the tumor microenvironment. To achieve this, Sara employs various NGS technologies and quantitative methods to analyze both experimental animal models and clinical data, with a special focus on single-cell technologies.

While at the Getz Lab, she is working on integrating transcriptomic and genomic data at single-cell level to delve into the progression mechanisms and the evolutionary dynamics of multiple myeloma.

Before starting her PhD, Sara worked in Dr. Mario Fraga’s lab, where she studied the role of epigenetics in childhood leukemias. She holds a Master’s degree in Biomedicine and Molecular Oncology from the University of Oviedo.

Sara is passionate about research that has a clinical or translational impact, with the ultimate goal of improving human health outcomes. In her free time, she enjoys traveling, practicing yoga, reading, and never turns down a good coffee or beer with friends.
