After graduating from MIT in June 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Molecular Biology, I joined the group to complete my Master's of Engineering degree from MIT in the same field. On completion of my Master's in 2020, I continued my work with the group as an ACB. I am working on projects related to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in cancer in the context of rapid autopsies in collaboration with IBM and MGH. We use computational methods to examine and understand the spread of cancer throughout the body and patients' resistance to therapies. to Outside of the lab, I am a competitive rower on the Charles River, most recently winning the Head of the Charles regatta in the lightweight single in 2021.
