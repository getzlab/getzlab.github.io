Alex is visiting the Getz Lab from the University of Cambridge, UK. 

Alex completed his Biochemistry BA and then MD (MB BChir) at the University of Cambridge. He completed his medical internship in London. He worked for two years at Cancer Research UK in Manchester during which he completed a Masters (MRes) in Oncology focusing on tumour reactive T cell expansion and worked as a co-investigator in the Experimental Cancer Medicine Team. 

Alex completed his training (residency) in internal medicine in Cambridge (MRCP). This was paired with a National Institute for Health Research funded Academic Clinical Fellowship in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics during which he completed the consultant/attending level Diploma in Pharmaceutical Medicine. Alex paired with the pharmaceutical company, Sosei Heptares, to create a first-in-human clinical trial of an immuno-modulator paired with immune checkpoint inhibition in several tumour types. This won funding from Cancer Research UK's Centre for Drug Development. Alex leads their bioinformatic analyses and has created a proprietary, putative, predictive gene signature.

Alex is completing his training (fellowship) in medical oncology in Cambridge. This is paired with a National Institute for Health Research funded Academic Clinical Fellowship in Medical Oncology. He has attended the Methods in Clinical Cancer Research Workshop funded by the Cancer Research UK Cancer Centre to develop a first in human pancreatic cancer trial. Alex has a Cancer Research UK bursary (grant) with the Caldas lab at Cancer Research UK's Cambridge Institute to explore T and B cell repertoires in early stage breast cancer. 

In the Getz lab, Alex is focusing on biomarker identification for and the prediction of immunotherapy response in advanced lung cancer. Alex is hoping to be a clinician scientist in early phase trials.
