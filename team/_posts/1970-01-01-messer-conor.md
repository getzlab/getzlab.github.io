Conor Messer is a bioengineer passionate about coming up with transformative solutions in the healthcare space. Though his breadth of interests led to experience in medical device prototyping, robotics, and prosthetics in his undergraduate years, his interest in computer science ultimately led him to the Broad Institute. He has enjoyed the tight coupling of computational techniques and biological understanding along with the rigorous intellectual environment here at the Broad. His work now focuses on understanding the drivers of resistance to immune therapy in various cancers, with particular focus on the modeling of the copy number profile. 

Conor received a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering from Northeastern University right here in Boston. Directly after his undergraduate studies, he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to study surgical soft robots in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Though this time was cut short by COVID-19, he relished the chance to be immersed in Arab culture and develop many close friendships. Beyond his professional interests, Conor has a variety of passions: theology and bioethics; music of all forms (especially jazz and acapella); being active through biking, running, hiking, backpacking, skiing, rock climbing or anything else that gets him outside!
