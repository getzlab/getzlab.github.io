Johann is a visiting graduate student in the Getz Lab, where he is working on machine learning algorithms to learn patient representations from single-cell RNA sequencing data. He recently completed his master's in mathematics at ETH Zurich and is set to begin his PhD in computer science at EPFL, where he aspires to develop methods to advance personalized medicine through the use of genomics data and machine learning.

Outside of the lab, Johann enjoys cooking, playing tennis, skiing, and spending time with friends.
