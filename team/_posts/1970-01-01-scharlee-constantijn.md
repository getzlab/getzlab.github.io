Constantijn is a Visiting Graduate Intern from Belgium, where he is a medical student at the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven). He holds a BSc in Medicine from KU Leuven and is currently enrolled in their Master of Medicine program. At the Getz Lab his main interest is the study of somatic mutations in normal tissues, an area of research he is exploring in the SMaHT consortium project. Aside from this, Constantijn is also interested in cancer genomics and precision oncology.

He has previously been a student-researcher at KU Leuven (Translational Cell & Tissue Research, Roskams Lab) and the University of Cambridge (MRC Toxicology Unit, Aitken Lab). After a thesis project on cancer genomics under the supervision of professor Jonas Demeulemeester (VIB/KUL), Constantijn decided to look for international opportunities to further explore his research interests. For his stay in the USA he has received an Honorary Fellowship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF).

Outside of research and medical school, Constantijn enjoys literature (especially poetry), playing the (bass) guitar, chess, visiting musea and he'll never decline invitations to trivia quizzes. His sartorial penchant for tweed jackets, wool jumpers, and corduroy often leaves him looking like he just strolled off the set of a 1930s period drama.
