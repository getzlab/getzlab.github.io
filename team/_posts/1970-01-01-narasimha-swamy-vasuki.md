Vasuki joined the Getz lab as a Computational Biologist in 2023. Prior to joining the lab, she was an Applied AI research scientist at Intel Labs where she worked on problems at the intersection of AI and wireless communication. 

Vasuki received her PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from University of California Berkeley in 2018 where she was advised by Prof. Anant Sahai. Her dissertation focussed on the design and analysis of wireless communication framework for highly interactive futuristic applications that demanded low latency and high reliability communication. 

Vasuki loves teaching and was heavily involved in the development and teaching of undergraduate classes at Berkeley. She is very passionate about health issues that primarily affect people assigned female at birth -- especially endometriosis and PCOS. In her free time, she loves to read books especially sci-fi and fantasy fiction, dance, cook and play with furry animals.
