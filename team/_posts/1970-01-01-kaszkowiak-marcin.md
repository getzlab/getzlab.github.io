Marcin is an MD and a PhD student at the Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion in Warsaw, Poland, and a visiting scientist at Getz lab. Combining knowledge from his medical (Medical University of Lodz) and computer science (University of Lodz) education, Marcin uses mathematical, statistical, and machine learning models to uncover molecular characteristics of cancer responsible for heterogenous responses to treatment and resistance development. In his PhD project, he investigates the resistance mechanisms to CAR-T cell therapy in B-cell malignancies in search of additional therapeutic options.

In the Getz lab, he is part of a project searching for molecular determinants of response to immunotherapy in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma in cooperation with Dr. Margaret Shipp's Lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 

Amateur cybersecurity researcher. In his free time, Marcin enjoys tennis and sailing. Legend has it that he has never refused a game of chess.
