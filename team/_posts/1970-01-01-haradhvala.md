Nick is a Computational Biologist at the [Broad Institute] in the Getz Lab. He joined the Getz Lab in 2014. He received his PhD in [Biophysics] from Harvard University in 2022. 

Nick's current research focuses on the use of single-cell sequencing technologies to study the role of the immune system in cancer. He has studied alterations to the immune micronenvironment in early multiple myeloma precursors, and the failure mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy in high-grade lymphomas.

In addition, he has interests studying the mechanisms of DNA damage and repair processes through analysis of their mutational patterns. His works have included the characterization of the strand-asymmetric footprints induced by replication- and transcription-associated processes, and identification of the mutational signatures present in cancer as part of the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project.
