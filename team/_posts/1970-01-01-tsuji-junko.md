I am a computational scientist in the Getz Lab. Prior to fully joining the lab in 2022, I had been working as a computational scientist in the Genomics Platform at [the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) for developing and benchmarking analysis pipelines to ensure quality control of cancer related sequencing data since 2017.  My main focus in the lab is going to be single cell data analyses on cancers.

As for my educational background, I completed my postdoctoral training at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. I obtained a Ph.D. and a M.S. in computational biology from the University of Tokyo, and received a B.S. in engineering from Soka University (Japan).

Outside of work, I love traveling to explore new places and finding nice brewries, distilleries, and wineries on the way.
