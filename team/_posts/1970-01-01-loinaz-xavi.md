Xavi joined the lab as an associate computational biologist in July of 2021 after graduating with an Sc.B. in Computational Biology (with a focus in applied math/statistics) and A.B. in Engineering from Brown University. After dabbling in various wet lab/bioengineering research throughout undergrad, the summer before his senior year he started conducting computational biology research under Prof. Ritambhara Singh and wrote his honors thesis on using deep learning (specifically graph convolutional neural networks) to integrate Hi-C data to model long-range epigenetic regulatory interactions. Since Xavi has joined the Getz Lab he has focused on genomic analysis of several projects under the Genomic Data Analysis Network funded by the National Cancer Institute (for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, lung cancer, human cancer models, and inferring cancer molecular subtypes using compact feature sets), as well as quality assurance of the lab's whole-genome mutation/copy number/structural variant-calling pipelines. He developed and maintains the lab's most up-to-date structural variant-calling pipeline. In addition, Xavi is also the lead developer for SSVGAR (Significant Structural Variant Genic Association Revelation; pronounced "sugar"), a new method for finding genomic cancer drivers via structural variation which has been applied in manuscripts currently under review to journals such as *Nature Medicine*, and has worked on rewriting one of the lab's structural variant-calling algorithms, dRanger, to increase sensitivity of detection. Outside of research, Xavi enjoys reading, baseball and basketball statistics, CrossFit, and occasionally pushing fashion norms with his pants.
