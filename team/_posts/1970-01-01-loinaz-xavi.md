Xavi joined the lab as an associate computational biologist in July of 2021 after graduating with an Sc.B. in Computational Biology and A.B. in Engineering from Brown University, where he wrote his honors thesis on using graph convolutional neural networks to integrate Hi-C data to model long-range epigenetic regulatory interactions. Since joining the Getz Lab, Xavi has focused on several clinical projects, including the analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, validation of human cancer models, and pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes. He also has a special interest in structural variation in cancer, working on method development for inferring cancer drivers via structural variation, development and maintenance of the lab's structural variant-calling pipeline, rewriting one of the lab's structural variant-calling algorithms to increase sensitivity of detection, and application of these tools to novel cohorts. Outside of research, Xavi enjoys reading, baseball and basketball statistics, and CrossFit.
